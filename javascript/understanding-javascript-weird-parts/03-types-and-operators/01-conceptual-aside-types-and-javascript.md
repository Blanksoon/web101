# 01 Conceptual aside types and javascript

#### Javascript use Dynamic typing

Dynamic typing is you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, It's figures it out while your code is running

variable can hold differnce types of values because it's all figured out during execution.

#### Static typing

```java
bool num = true // error
```

#### Dynamic typing

```javascript
var num = 2
num = 'nqmt'
num =true
```
